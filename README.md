# User Centric Front End Development Project: Gym Website 

For my project I have designed a website for the fictional gym of "Rathmines Health Club", a leisure gym based in the Dublin 8 Area. The aim of the 
website is to be a aesthetically pleasing, yet functional advert for the gym with the goal of attracting new memberships. The website is built using HTML, CSS and some basic
Javascript using the bootstrap framework to streamline the web development process. 
 
## UX
 
User Experiences

- As a new user to the gym, I want to apply for membership or be contacted by staff from the gym who can assist 
with any necessary info. The landing page of the website prompts the user with a 'join now' button that send the user to a 
contact page where they can fill out a form. 
- A user who is curious about the website will be able to accesss a gallery page that has bright photos and  videos showcasing the
gym's different facilities. The website also contains an 'about' page that details the focus and values of the gym while also promting the 
user to contact the gym through the a button prompt.
-As a user who is currently a member of the gym, the website offers a responive 'timetable' section that displays the day, time and type of gym class that the 
health club offers during the week. At the bottom of each webpage there is also a responsive footer that diplays essential info 
for the gym including the socila media url's aswell as opening hours and location. 

I've attatched my orginal wireframes in the 'wireframes' folder. While much of the layout has stayed the same since the websites inception, the color palet and footer layout are some 
of many design features that ultimately changed in the end. The frames are split into the various desktop and 'mobile' layouts depending on the screen size. 

## Features

Home Page--This will be a eye-catching first introduction for the consumer ot the gym with a prompt and some accompanying text to nudge the user towards contacting the club for membership. 
Timetable--The website will have a responsive timetable for both current and prospective members to check the time, day and type of fitness class that is taking place during the week. 
Gallery--A gallery will be included on the website, with a responsive grid that uses JS effects when users hover over the image . There is also an embeded youtube modal if the photo is clicked. 
Contact-Form--The website will have several button prompts as well as a dedicated html page that will allow the user to fill in forms for their name, phone number and email address. 
About-Page --The website will contain an about page, with a brief bio regarding the aims and ethos of the club along with a photo of the gym's staff and management. 
Responsive-Footer--The website will contain a responsive footer, that will display the social media logos for the club. In bigger screen sizes the footer will reveal more info regarding the clubs
with accompanying fonts and logos.
